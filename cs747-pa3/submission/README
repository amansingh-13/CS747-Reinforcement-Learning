- To run the part 1:

   Execute 
   ``` python3 mountain_car.py --task T1 --train 1 ```

   This will generate the plot T1.jpg and the weights will be
   stored into T1.npy. Another thing to note is that the 
   training takes "3 min 50 s" to run on an Intel i5 processor.
   
   To test the submission just exectute :
   ``` python3 mountain_car.py --task T1 --train 0 ```

- To run the part 2:

   Execute 
   ``` python3 mountain_car.py --task T2 --train 1 ```

   This will generate the plot T2.jpg and the weights will be
   stored into T2.npy. Another thing to note is that the 
   training takes "4 min 20 s" to run on an Intel i5 processor.
   
   To test the submission just exectute :
   ``` python3 mountain_car.py --task T2 --train 0 ```

All commands should be executed in submission folder.
